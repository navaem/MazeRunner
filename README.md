 I, Ed Nava, worked and completed this project for my ECE 2035 final project. It
 is a game that is playable on the LPC1768 Mbed kit. It incorporates an LCD, 4 
 buttons, an accelerometer, a speaker, and an SD card slot for external storage.
 the game implementes 3 levels each with its own layout and obstacles. The game 
 may be configured to have the ball move faster(harder gamemode) or slower than
 normal. The buttons have multiple functions from skipping the current level, to
 engaging the special ability which can only be used once. If the player beats 
 the game the GAMEOVER sound and screen will display.
